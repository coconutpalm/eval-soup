[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/eval-soup.svg)](https://clojars.org/eval-soup)

## Introduction

A nice eval wrapper for Clojure and ClojureScript. See [the dynadocs](https://oakes.github.io/eval-soup/cljs/eval-soup.core.html) for documentation and examples.

## Usage

You can include this library in your project dependencies using the version number in the badge above.

To experiment with this library in a REPL, you can use [the Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools). In this directory, run `clj` to start a Clojure REPL, or `clj -R:cljs -m cljs.repl.node` to start a ClojureScript REPL. When the REPL is up, enter the main namespace with `(require 'eval-soup.core) (in-ns 'eval-soup.core)`.
